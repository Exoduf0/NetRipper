# NetRipper - Bandwidth Consumption Tool for Server,Internet Testing

NetRipper is a JavaScript tool designed for educational purposes to test websites or internet connections by sending large packets (1,000,000 KB or 1 GB per packet) that can consume all of the available bandwidth at the tested server.

## Overview

NetRipper is a bandwidth consumption tool that allows you to simulate heavy network traffic to assess how a website or server handles high bandwidth utilization. This tool sends large packets, each consuming 1 GB of bandwidth on both the user's and the tested server's side. It's an educational tool intended for learning and understanding network behavior under extreme conditions.

## Features

- Send large packets (1,000,000 KB / 1 GB per packet) to test website or server bandwidth.
- Simulate heavy network traffic to analyze server performance.
- Educational tool for learning about bandwidth consumption and server behavior.


**Note:** Use this tool responsibly and only in educational settings.
